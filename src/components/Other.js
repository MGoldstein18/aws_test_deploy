              What is Uniswap?
            </b>{" "}

                  Uniswap is a fully decentralized crypto exchange which
                  operates by executing smart contracts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Because Uniswap is decentralized and open-source it is a
                  protocol which means that it allows people to take the
                  underlying code infrastructure and build their own version of
                  it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is different to a regular exchange like Coinbase because
                  the prices are set by smart contracts and you have full
                  control over you assets instead of them being in an exchange.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Additionally, Uniswap is different because it uses an
                  automated liquidity pool instead of an order book.{" "}
                  <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic", color: "orangered" }}>
                    What does that mean?

                    <li>
                      It means that if you buy/sell on an exchange like
                      Coinbase, you need someone to be on the other side of your
                      trade in the Coinbase order book, ie: you need someone who
                      is buying what you are selling or someone who is selling
                      what you are buying.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      However, Uniswap uses an automated liquidity pool which is
                      a pool of assets contributed by other users of Uniswap.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When you transact you are buying from/selling to this pool
                      of assets. The users who contributed assets to the pool
                      receive a part of the transaction fee of each transaction.
