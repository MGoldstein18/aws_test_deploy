                  A blockchain can be thought of as a giant ledger which records
                  transactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transactions are added to the blockchain by a group of people.
                  These people are called miners.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To ensure that all transactions on the blockchain are
                  accurate, a copy of the blockchain is stored on many computers
                  around the world and this network of computers checks to
                  ensure that the blockchain is the same on all the computers.
                  This ensures that nobody can destroy the integrity of the
                  blockchain.

                  A cryptocurrency is a digital currency for which all
                  transactions are stored on a blockchain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A cryptocurrency can be valuable because, with it, you can
                  transact on a blockchain and enjoy the benefits of the various
                  applications and services offered on blockchains. Please see
                  our question: "What can I buy on the blockchain?" for more
                  details.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Another reason that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum
                  are valuable is because they are deflationary. This means that
                  they are not subject to inflation like most other currencies
                  are.

                  The Blockchain has many applications and because it is
                  relatively new in the world, there are new applications been

                <li>
                  A blockchain like Ethereum is programmable, which means that
                  developers can create smart contracts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A smart contract is a piece of code which enforces a set of
                  rules. Because these rules are written into the code, parties
                  who donâ€™t know or trust each other can trust the transaction -
                  a "trustless transaction".

                  Exchanging cryptocurrencies and NFTs are some of the
                  transactions you can do on a blockchain. There are exchanges,
                  lending mechanisms, savings accounts, betting markets, social
                  networks and much more.
